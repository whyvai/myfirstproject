Ever go out with friends and end up paying for everything? ME TOO. This oneâ€™s for my fellow donators, sugar parents, and human wallets ðŸ’”

A SIMPLE EXPENSE SPLITTERðŸ¤‘

We all donâ€™t wanna sound like THAT person but yâ€™all shouldnâ€™t hesitate (I can). Hereâ€™s something helpful and fun (kinda) that can lowkey ask your friends for YOUR money ugh.

what it does:
- Takes your expenses: Input the names of your friends and how much each person paid.
- Calculates the total: Adds up all the expenses like a spreadsheet (less boring tho)
- Splits the bill: Divides the total by the number of people so you can see who owes who.
- Shows who should pay: Tells you who owes you money and who needs to stop freeloading/s
  
how to use it: (no one will)
1. Download or clone the project from GitHub.
2. Open the terminal (or command prompt).
3. Run this command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
