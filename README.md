Ever go out with friends and end up paying for everything? ME TOO. This one’s for my fellow donators, sugar parents, and human wallets 💔



A SIMPLE EXPENSE SPLITTER🤑



We all don’t wanna sound like THAT person but y’all shouldn’t hesitate (I can). Here’s something helpful and fun (kinda) that can lowkey ask your friends for YOUR money ugh.



what it does:

- Takes your expenses: Input the names of your friends and how much each person paid.

- Calculates the total: Adds up all the expenses like a spreadsheet (less boring tho)

- Splits the bill: Divides the total by the number of people so you can see who owes who.

- Shows who should pay: Tells you who owes you money and who needs to stop freeloading/s


  
How to Run This Without Stress (now one will):

-Click the green “Code” button on this page and choose “Download ZIP.”

-Unzip the downloaded file. You’ll get a folder with the project.

-Open that folder and make sure the main.py file is inside.

-Right-click inside the folder and select: “Open in Terminal” or “Open in Command Prompt”(on Windows)

-Type python main.py and hit Enter:
